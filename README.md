Errors:
If two (or more) branches try to merge to master without the group pulling form master after the first branch, conflicts will arise. We will have to resolve conflicts and then merge the resolved PR

Two pushes to master. The 1st push is accepted but if the group doesn't pull from master then the individual pushing to master will have to resolve conflicts by pulling from master and then pushing their changes.
